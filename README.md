# Python Improved

A better Python `.tmLanguage` syntax highlighting definition for [Sublime Text](http://www.sublimetext.com) and [TextMate](http://www.macromates.com). It includes support for both Python 2 and Python 3, and unlike any other Python syntax definition now fully supports Unicode identifiers anywhere in your code! It also provides its own improved regex syntax definition for inline highlighting of raw string literals.

Syntax highlighting borrowed from [PythonImproved](https://github.com/MattDMo/PythonImproved)
