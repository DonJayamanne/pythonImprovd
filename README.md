# Python Improved

An improved Python `.tmLanguage` syntax highlighting definition for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com). It includes support for both Python 2 and Python 3, and unlike any other Python syntax definition now fully supports Unicode identifiers anywhere in your code! It also provides its own improved regex syntax definition for inline highlighting of raw string literals.
